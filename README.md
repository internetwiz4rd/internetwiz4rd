Space wizard in-training

Enthusiastic about:

- FOSS culture and history
- Nix and NixOS
- Rust
- The stars
- Using lessons from the computing space elsewhere in my life
- Feeling pretty

Repos:

- [My personal dotfiles, configuring every aspect of my system](https://github.com/internetwiz4rd/dotfiles)
  - Everything's (mostly) reproducable using Nix
  - Included is my Neovim config, which you can try out using `nix run 'github:internetwiz4rd/dotfiles?dir=.config/nvim'`!!
- [My personal site on the indie web, a heavy heavy WIP](https://github.com/internetwiz4rd/wizards-lair)
  - Hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), and written completely in Rust using [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) for some reason
  - Check out what little I've done at [www.wizardslair.org](https://www.wizardslair.org)!
